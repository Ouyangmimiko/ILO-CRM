<h3>2. System Overview</h3>

<p>The ILO CRM is a system developed specifically for the Industry Liaison Office (ILO) team, mainly used for managing and tracking industry partnerships. The user interface of the system is divided into two main modules: User Management and Engagement Management, allowing users to perform different management tasks.</p>

<h3>3. User Roles and Permissions</h3>

<p><strong>Roles:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Master Admin:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Has the highest level of access. The Master Admin's sidebar shows both the Engagement Management and User Management modules.</li>
    <li>The Master Admin can perform all management operations, including system user management, role management, database management, and project management. Only this role can perform permission-related operations (e.g., viewing and switching roles).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Normal Admin:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The Normal Admin's sidebar only displays the Engagement Management module, without the User Management.</li>
    <li>On the Engagement Management page, the Normal Admin can perform CRUD operations, including adding, deleting, viewing, and editing contact information.</li>
    <li>The Normal Admin cannot access the User Management module and therefore cannot manage users or roles.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The User's sidebar also only displays the Engagement Management module.</li>
    <li>On the Engagement Management page, the User can only browse contact information, without any add, delete, or edit permissions (i.e., no corresponding buttons are available).</li>
    <li>The User cannot access any management functions, including user and role management.</li>
</ul>
